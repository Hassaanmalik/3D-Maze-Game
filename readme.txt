Maze.c:
this uses lighting, materials, texture, fog, sto create a simple maze program.

Textures - there are two textures being used; one for the walls, and another for the floor
Materials - there are different materials being used for the floors, walls, trophy, and the ghost
Lighting - Lighting is placed at the head of the user, making it so light points wherever they look
There is a grey background for the sky with fog to create a gloomy atmosphere.

The point of the game is to move through the maze and find the trophy before the ghost catches you! 
** note, for a more easier game, move the trophy to 83, 0, 78 (change px, py, pz);
